usage: translate [-h] [-t TYPE] [-o OUTFILE] [-c CLASS_NAME] [-y]
                 [--expose-annotated-variables]
                 cellml_file

Chaste code generation for cellml.

positional arguments:
  cellml_file           The cellml file or URI to convert to chaste code

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t TYPE, --translate-type TYPE
                        the type of code to output [default: Chaste]. Choices:
                        ['Chaste']
  -o OUTFILE            write program code to OUTFILE [default action is to
                        use the input filename with a different extension]
                        NOTE: expects provided OUTFILE to have an extension
                        relevant to code being generated (e.g. for CHASTE/C++
                        code: .cpp, .c, .hpp, or .c)

Generated code options:
  -c CLASS_NAME, --class-name CLASS_NAME
                        explicitly set the name of the generated class

Chaste options:
  Options specific to Chaste code output

  -y, --dll, --dynamically-loadable
                        add code to allow the model to be compiled to a shared
                        library and dynamically loaded (only works if -t
                        Chaste is used)
  --expose-annotated-variables
                        expose all oxmeta-annotated variables for access via
                        the GetAnyVariable functionality
